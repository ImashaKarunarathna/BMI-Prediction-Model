# BMI-Prediction-Model
The BMI prediction model is a simple tool that calculates your Body Mass Index using your height and weight. It helps you see if your weight is in a healthy range. By entering your height and weight, the model quickly tells you if you're underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
